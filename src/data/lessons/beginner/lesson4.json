  "notes": "# Basic Greetings & Expressions\n\n## Starting a Conversation\nPoliteness is key in Deaf culture. Here are the essentials:\n\n### 1. Hello / Hi\n- **Sign**: A simple wave with the palm facing outward, or a salute from the forehead.\n- **Context**: Used at the start of any interaction.\n\n### 2. How are you?\n- **Sign**: Place both hands with knuckles touching lightly on the chest, then rotate them outward/upward to a 'thumbs up' position.\n- **Expression**: Raise your eyebrows to show it is a question.\n\n## Time of Day Greetings\nMost greetings combine the sign for **GOOD** (Thumb up, or hand from chin to palm) with the time of day.\n\n- **Good Morning**: \n  - *Morning*: Touch your fingertips to the inside of your opposite elbow, raising the arm up (like the sun rising).\n\n- **Good Afternoon**: \n  - *Afternoon*: Keep your arm horizontal at eye level, hand flat or slightly cupped pointing down.\n\n- **Good Evening**: \n  - *Evening*: Curve your hand over your other wrist/arm (like the sun setting).\n\n## Polite Expressions\n\n### Please\n- **Sign**: Place a flat hand on your chest and move it in a circular motion (clockwise).\n- **Context**: Used when asking for help or requesting something.\n\n### Thank You\n- **Sign**: Touch your fingertips to your chin (palm flat), then move the hand forward toward the person you are thanking.\n- **Context**: Always use this to show appreciation.",
