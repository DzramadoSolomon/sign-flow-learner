  "notes": "# GSL Alphabet: Letters F-J\n\n## Building on Your Foundation\nGreat work learning A-E! Now let's expand your fingerspelling skills with five more letters.\n\n## Letter F\n- **Hand Shape**: Index and thumb form circle, other fingers extended\n- **Position**: Palm facing forward\n- **Tip**: Make a clear circle with thumb and index\n\n## Letter G\n- **Hand Shape**: Index finger and thumb extended horizontally, pointing to the side\n- **Position**: Palm facing to your side\n- **Tip**: Keep both digits parallel to the ground\n\n## Letter H\n- **Hand Shape**: Index and middle fingers extended horizontally together\n- **Position**: Palm facing to your side\n- **Tip**: Keep fingers close together\n\n## Letter I\n- **Hand Shape**: Pinky finger extended, all others closed\n- **Position**: Palm facing forward\n- **Tip**: Keep pinky straight up\n\n## Letter J\n- **Hand Shape**: Same as 'I' but with a 'J' motion\n- **Position**: Start with pinky up, draw a 'J' in the air\n- **Tip**: Make the motion smooth and clear\n\n## Review Section\nRemember your A-E letters! Practice transitioning between old and new letters:\n- A → F\n- B → G  \n- C → H\n- D → I\n- E → J\n\n## Practice Words\nNow you can spell: FACE, BADGE, CAGE, DEAF, BEAD, FADED, JADED\n\n## Important Notes\n- Letter 'J' is the only letter in A-J that involves movement\n- Pay attention to palm orientation - it changes!\n- Practice slowly, then gradually increase speed",
