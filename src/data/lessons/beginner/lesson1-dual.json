    "notes": "# Getting Started With GSL (Visual Mode)\n\n## Why Learn GSL?\nGhanaian Sign Language (GSL) is more than communication — it is **connection**, **identity**, and **access**. Learning GSL helps create inclusive interactions between Deaf and hearing individuals.\n\n### Key Reasons GSL Matters:\n- It allows clear communication with Deaf individuals.\n- It supports accessibility and inclusion.\n- It helps break social barriers.\n- It builds confidence when interacting with the Deaf community.\n\n---\n\n## Fingerspelling vs Signing\n\n### **Fingerspelling**\nUsed to spell names, places, or words without established signs.  
- Hand produces **letters**.\n- Typically slower.\n- Used for emphasis or clarity.\n\n### **Sign Words**\nUses established gestures representing whole words or ideas.\n- Faster and more expressive.\n- More natural for everyday conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Facial Expressions in GSL\nGSL uses **non-manual signals** (NMS) such as:\n- Eyebrow movement\n- Head tilt\n- Lip movement\n- Eye direction\n\nThese add **emotion, grammar, and intent** to signs.\n\nExample:\n- Raised eyebrows = yes/no question\n- Furrowed eyebrows = WH-question (who, what, where...)\n\n---\n\n## Body Movement\nYour upper body gives **context and clarity**:\n- Lean forward to show interest\n- Lean back to show uncertainty\n- Turn slightly to indicate different subjects\n\n---\n\n## Starter Practical Signs\n\n### 1. **HELLO**  
Simple wave near the temple.\n\n### 2. **MY NAME**  
\"MY\" → palm on chest  
\"NAME\" → U-shape fingers tapping twice\n\n### 3. **HOW ARE YOU?**  
Slight forward movement, questioning facial expression.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Reminders\n✓ Keep hands at chest level  
✓ Make clear, confident movements  
✓ Maintain eye contact  
✓ Use facial expressions\n\n---",
