  "notes": "# Getting Started with GSL\n\n## Why is GSL Important?\nGhanaian Sign Language (GSL) is more than just hand movements; it is the primary language of the Deaf community in Ghana. \n- **Inclusion**: Learning GSL bridges the communication gap between hearing and Deaf individuals.\n- **Access**: It allows Deaf people to access essential services like healthcare, education, and legal justice.\n- **Culture**: It fosters a deeper respect for the Deaf culture and community in Ghana.\n\n## Fingerspelling vs. Signing\nIn GSL, we use two main methods to convey words:\n\n1. **Fingerspelling**: This involves spelling out a word letter-by-letter using the manual alphabet. It is mostly used for:\n   - Names of people or places (proper nouns).\n   - Words that do not have a specific sign.\n\n2. **Signing Words**: This involves using a single hand motion to represent a whole concept or word.\n   - **Speed**: Signing words is significantly **faster** and more efficient than fingerspelling every letter.\n   - **Flow**: It allows for natural conversation flow.\n\n## Facial Expressions & Body Motion\nMany beginners make the mistake of having a \"blank face\" while signing. However, your face and body are your grammar!\n\n- **Facial Cues**: Eyebrow movements, mouth shapes, and head tilts act as the \"tone of voice.\" They can change a statement into a question or indicate the intensity of an emotion (e.g., \"happy\" vs. \"very happy\").\n- **Body Motion**: Shifting your torso or shoulders can indicate different speakers in a story or separate different concepts.\n\n**Remember**: In GSL, a sign without a facial expression is like speaking in a robotic monotone voice.",
