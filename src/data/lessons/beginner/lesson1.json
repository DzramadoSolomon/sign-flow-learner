Practice each letter slowly at first\n2. Use a mirror to check your hand shapes\n3. Focus on smooth transitions between letters\n4. Practice spelling simple words: CAB, BED, ACE\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Letting your thumb stick out too much (Letter A)\n- Not keeping fingers together (Letter B)\n- Making the 'C' too flat or too closed\n- Bending the index finger in Letter D\n- Not curving fingers enough in Letter E",
