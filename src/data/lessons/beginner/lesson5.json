  "notes": "# Introducing Yourself\n\n## My Name Is...\nIn GSL, we don't usually sign the word \"IS\". The sentence structure is efficient.\n- **Sign**: **MY** (Palm on chest) + **NAME** (Index and middle fingers of both hands tap forming an X shape) + **[FINGERSPELL NAME]**.\n[Image of 'My Name' sign in sign language]\n\n## Nice to Meet You\n- **Nice**: Palms slide across each other (like washing hands, but flat).\n- **Meet**: Both hands form a fist with index fingers pointing up. Move hands together until knuckles/fingers touch.\n- **You**: Point to the person.\n\n\n## Where do you live?\n- **I Live In...**: \n  - **I**: Point to yourself.\n  - **Live**: Thumbs up (or 'A' handshape) moving up the chest/body.\n  - **In**: One hand places fingers inside the cupped palm of the other.\n\n\n## Questions: What is your name?\nIn GSL, the \"Who/What/Where\" question word often comes at the **end** of the sentence with a furrowed brow.\n- **Structure**: **YOUR** + **NAME** + **WHAT?**\n- **Expression**: Squeeze eyebrows together to show you are asking a question.\n\n## Learning GSL\n- **Phrase**: \"I am learning Sign Language.\"\n- **Learn**: Take one hand and pretend to pick something up from your open palm and put it against your forehead (absorbing knowledge).\n- **Sign Language**: Both hands roll over each other in a circular motion.",
